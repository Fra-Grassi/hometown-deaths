# hometown-deaths
Just a little project analyzing the time-series of deaths in my hometown.

In my very little hometown of Castelluccio dei Sauri, in south Italy, there is this saying that "people always dies in groups of three". Meaning that every time someone dies, other two people will follow them in a very short time.
I've always been curious about this creepy weird saying, so I decided to investigate whether any data supports it.
